Dependencies:
============

- Blackadder
- libtool
- autoconf
- automake

Installation
============

# ./configure
# make && make install

If needed, you can regenerate `./configure' by running` autoreconf -i'.

See the ../doc/HowTo file for detailed information about configure and
make the library.

Language Bindings
=================

By default, only the default C++ API is compiled and installed.

Additional language bindings can be enabled by passing one or more
`--enable-LANGUAGE' options to `configure'. Run `./configure --help'
to see which languages are supported.

Some additional stand-alone language bindings can also be found in
their respective directories under the `bindings' directory. Such
bindings need to be compiled (and installed) separately.
