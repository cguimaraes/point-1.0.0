 * \brief Trace class to write per packet NAP trace file
 *
 * This class allows to trace every single sent or received packet to be written
 * to a trace file using the following tsv format:
 * [1] NAP Timestamp [s]
 * [2] Packet processing time [Î¼s]
 * [3] Operational mode
 * [4] Packet type
 *
 * --- if ARP ---
 * [5] ARP Type
 * [6] SRC IP
 * [7] DST IP
 * [8] SRC MAC Address
 * [9] DST MAC Address
 *
 * --- if IP ---
 * [5] SRC IP
 * [6] DST IP
 * [7] DST port number
 * [8] Layer 3 packet length (IP header + payload)
 * [9] Fragmentated packet
 *
 * --- if ICN ---
 * [5] ICN ID
 * [6] Packet length (ICN packet payload)
 * [7] Transport State
 * [8] Transport Sequence
 * [9] Transport Key
 * --- if HTTP ---
 * [5] Method number
 * 	---	Request
 * 	[6] URL
 * 	[7] Hashed resource
 * 	---	Response
 * 	[6] Resource
 * 	[7] Hashed resource
 *
 * IMPORTANT: While in operation the trace file will be only truncated. All
 * trace data is only written to internal output file stream in order to not
 * slow down the NAP by writing to disk. Once the NAP is requested to terminate
 * the deconstructor of the Trace class is called and the output file stream is
 * written to the trace file. In other words, a '$ tail -f napTrace.txt' while
 * the NAP is running won't show anything.
